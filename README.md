This project uses [http://threejs.org/](Three.js)



Elements we want:
* A train. Toy/Brio-style. We would like to use this model: http://www.the3dstudio.com/product_details.aspx?id_product=578770
* A terrain with a mountain (and some water?)
* (Perhaps a bridge over the water?)
* A tunnel that goes through the mountain
* Smoke for the train
* ???

Effects we want:
* Ascii style glitchyness (also, the music turns 8-bit when the visuals turn into ascii)
* TV style noise/crackling/jitter (as a transition to/from the ascii effect)
* ???

The music:
* Length: 1m 54s
* Tempo: 120 bpm
* The first beat starts at approximately t = 870

The plot (roughly):
* Overview of the terrain
* Train is being built
* (Bridge is being built)
* Train moves over the bridge and approaches the tunnel
* Train moves through the tunnel
* Train exits the tunnel
