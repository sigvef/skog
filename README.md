This demo is now finished: <http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=61584>

This project uses [Three.js](http://threejs.org/)

Elements we want:
* A train. Toy/Brio-style. We would like to use this model: http://www.the3dstudio.com/product_details.aspx?id_product=578770
* A terrain with a mountain and some water
* A rail track
* A tunnel
* Smoke for the train
* Text

Effects we want:
* Ascii style glitchyness (also, the music turns 8-bit when the visuals turn into ascii)
* TV style noise/crackling/jitter (as a transition to/from the ascii effect)

The music:
* Length: 1m 54s
* Tempo: 120 bpm
* The first beat starts at approximately t = 870

The plot (roughly):
* Travelling in tunnel under water
  * Introduction text
* Overview of the terrain
* The train is being built
  * At first we only see front_body
  * Then middle_body and then rear_body fall down into place
  * Then the wheels arrive from the sides (first front, then middle and then rear)
  * Then the remaining parts (pole, cube etc) fall down from the top and are placed correctly on the train
* Rail track is being built
* Party time - Train drives over the track
* Ascii-effect
* Greets/shoutouts
