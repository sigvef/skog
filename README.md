This project uses [http://threejs.org/](Three.js)



Elements we want:
* A train. Toy/Brio-style. We would like to use this model: http://www.the3dstudio.com/product_details.aspx?id_product=578770
* A terrain with a mountain (and some water?)
* (Perhaps a bridge over the water?)
* A tunnel that goes through the mountain
* Smoke for the train
* Text (e.g. "Ninjadev is bach!" and shoutouts)
* ???

Effects we want:
* Ascii style glitchyness (also, the music turns 8-bit when the visuals turn into ascii)
* TV style noise/crackling/jitter (as a transition to/from the ascii effect)
* ???

The music:
* Length: 1m 54s
* Tempo: 120 bpm
* The first beat starts at approximately t = 870

The plot (roughly):
* Travelling in tunnel under water
  * Introduction text
* Camera breaks through the water surface from below, causing a splash
* Overview of the terrain
* The train is being built
  * At first we only see front_body
  * Then middle_body and then rear_body fall down into place
  * Then the wheels arrive from the sides (first front, then middle and then rear)
  * Then the remaining parts (pole, cube etc) fall down from the top and are placed correctly on the train
* (Bridge is being built)
* Train moves over the bridge and approaches the tunnel
* Train moves through the tunnel
  * We don't actually see the train. We see everything from the train's point of view.
* Train exits the tunnel
* On the last "choo" the camera zooms in on the smoke and everything fades to white
