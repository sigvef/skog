Hi everyone! This is a demo called TUNL-MNTN-WTER
( which  is  pronounced  "tunnel  mountain  water
train" ).  It is written in JavaScript/WebGL, and
uses THREE.js.  Most of the work on this demo was
put in during the first night of  Solskogen 2013.

For  best  results you  should run this with  the
latest version of Google Chrome.  If you  want to
run it  from  your  local file system,  which you
probably do if you are reading this,  remember to
start Chrome  with the  --allow-file-access-from-files
command-line argument.

This demo was in the new-school compo at
Solskogen 2013.
